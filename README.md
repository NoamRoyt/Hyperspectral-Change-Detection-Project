# Hyperspectral-Change-Detection-Project
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in hyperspectral images using two methods: Chronochrome and Covariance Equalization. These techniques analyze spectral images captured at different times to identify significant changes. Our goal is to evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of these methods in detecting anomalies.
